/*TITTLE: MODULE PATTERN : The main goal of the module pattern is to encapsulate functionality ti have private data
and to expose a public API and the best way of achieving all that is by simply using a function, because a function
give us private data by default and allow us to return values, which can become our public API*/

/*IIFE =  The reason is because this way we don't have to call it separately and we can also ensure that it's only
called once.*/

//This works for closures, remember allow a function to have access to all the variables that were present at its
//birthplace, so the addToCart function was created in the ShoppingCart2, so therefore this function never loses
//connection to its birthplace when we return the function.

const ShoppingCart2 = (function () {
  const cart = [];
  const shippingCost = 10;
  const totalPrice = 237;
  const totalQuantity = 23;

  const addToCart = function (product, quantity) {
    cart.push({ product, quantity });
    console.log(
      `${quantity} ${product} added to cart(sipping cost is ${shippingCost})`
      //shippingCost is accesible !
    );
