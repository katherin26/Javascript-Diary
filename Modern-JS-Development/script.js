give us private data by default and allow us to return values, which can become our public API*/

/*IIFE =  The reason is because this way we don't have to call it separately and we can also ensure that it's only
called once.*/

//This works for closures, remember allow a function to have access to all the variables that were present at its
//birthplace, so the addToCart function was created in the ShoppingCart2, so therefore this function never loses
//connection to its birthplace when we return the function.

/*TITTLE: COMMON JS MODULES
AMD MODULES AND COMMONJS MODULES

Recently Modules have actually been implemented in Node.js and this one is a way of running JS on a web server
outside of a browser, Now the big consequence of this, is that almost all the modules in the npm repository that
we can use in our own code still use the CommonJS  module System and the reason for that is that npm was originally
only intended for Node which uses commonJS , Later npm became the standar repository for the whole JS world.*/

/*EXPORT: 
This is not going to work in the browser but it would work in Node.js , So this export keyword here is basically
an object and is important in node.*/
/*
export.addTocart = function(product,quantity){
    cart.push({product, quantity});
    console.log(`${quantity} ${product} added to cart (sipping cost is ${shippingCost})`
    );
};*/

/*IMPORT: 
const {addTocart} = require('./shoppingCart.js)
*/

//TITTLE: INTRODUCTION TO NPM = using libraries in this case Lodash-es for clone an nested object.
/*
COMMANDS:

1.Check if we actually have NPM Installed  = NPM -v 
2.NPM initializing ---> questions in order to create package.json = NPM init 
3.Install a library (example) = NPM install leaflet  or NPM i leaflet
              
                   "dependencies" : {
                     "leaflet" : "^1.6.0"
                   }

LIBRARY = LODASH 

Work with objects, Functions, datos and more...

Special version = Lodash-es 

NPM i lodash-es

//NOTE: Using cloneDeep from lodash
