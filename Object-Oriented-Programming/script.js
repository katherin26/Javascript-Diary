/*TITTLE: CODING CHALLENGE 

1. Use a constructor function to implement a Car. A car has a make and a speed property. The speed 
property is the current speed speed of the car in km/h; 
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will incrase the car's speed by 10 , and log the new speed 
to the console.
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console;
4. Create 2 car objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them.

DATA CAR 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
DATA CAR 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h

/*TITTLE: CHALLENGE 2 
1.Re-create challenge 1 , but this time using and ES6 class;
2. Add a getter called 'speedUs' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide by 1.6);
3. Add a setter called 'speedUs' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but converts it to km/h before
storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6);
4. Create a new car and experiment with the accelerate and brake methods , and with the getter and setter.
