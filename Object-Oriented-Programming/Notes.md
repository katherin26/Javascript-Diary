# **What is ?? OOP**

```

const example = {
-------------------------------Data
    userExample: 'coco',
    password: 'dk23s',
-------------------------------Behaviour
    login(password){
        //Login logic
    },
    sendMessage(str){
        //Sending logic
    }
}
```

```
=> OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept objects = paradigm = Style of code "how" we write and organize code;
```

```
=> We use objects to model(describe) real-world or abstract features;
E.g. userExample or todo list item
E.g. HTML component or data structure
```

```
=> Objects may contain data (properties and code(methods).By using objects,we pack data and the corresponding
behavior into one block.
```

```
=> In OOP, objects are self-contained pieces/blocks of code.
```

```
=> Objects are building blocks of applications, and interact with one another.
```

```
=> Interactions happen through a public interface(API):methods that the code outside of the object can access and use to communicate with the project.
```

```
=> OOP was developed with the goal of organizing code, to make it more flexible and easier to maintain.
