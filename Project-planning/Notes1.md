# **WHY ARCHITECTURE??**

1. The architecture will give our project in which we can then write the code, just like a house,
   software also needs a structure.
   In sotfware, structure basically means how we organize and divide the code into different modules, classes and functions, all these will basically hold our code together and give it structure.

2. Maintainability, when we build a project we always need to think about the future and keep in  
   mind the project is never really done, it is never finished.

   We will always need to change things in the future and we will need to maintain the project and that only works if the project is nicely structured. Plus, we might even want to add new features to the project, which brings us to expandability.

   Expandability : is basically the ability to easily add new features in the future and once again, that is only possible with a good structure and a good overall architecture.

The perfect architecture is basically one that allows for all these three aspects of structure maintainability and expandability, Now, in order to achieve that perfect architecture, we can create our own architecture from scratch.

However, that only works with a really small project, but when the project grows more complex then it's going to be very hard to achieve a good architecture completely on our own, instead we can use a well established architecture pattern that developers have been using for years.

Example : Model view controller , Model view presenter, flux and many other architectures

```
Like a house, software                                                      - We can create our own
needs a structure: the way                                                  architecture.
we organize our code.                                                       - We can use a well-
                                                                            established architecture
                                      STRUCTURE                             pattern like MVC, MVP,
                                                                            Flux, etc.
                                                                            - We can use a framework like React, Angular, Vue.

                  MAINTAINABILITY                   EXPANDABILITY

A project is never done!
We need to be able to easily
change it in the future.
