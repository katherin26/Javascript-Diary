1. Write a function called 'describeCountry' which takes three parameters: 'country' , 'population'
and 'capitalCity'. Based on this input , the function returns a string with this format : 'Finland has 6 
million people and its capital city is Helsinki'

2. Call this function 3 times, with input data for 3 different countries. Store the returned values in 
3 different variables , and log them to the console.

1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration called 'percentageOfWorld1'

population represents. For example, China has 1441 million people , so it's about 18.2% of the world population.

2. To calculate the percentage , divide the given 'population' value by 7900 and then multiply by 100.
3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice, store the results into variables, 
and log them to the console.
4. Create a function expression , which does the exact same thing , called 'percentageOfWorld2' , and also call
it with 3 country populations (can be the same populations).

1. Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your choice. Choose a country

2. At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of your selected country.
So add it to the end of the 'neighbours' array .
3. Unfortunately , after some time , the new country is dissolved. So remove it from the end of the array.
4. If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country 'Germany' , log to the console: 'Probably not a 
central European country :D'
5. Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that , find the index of the country in the 
'neighbours' array, and then use that index to change the array at that index position .For example , you can
search for 'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'.

3. Add a method called 'checkIsland' to the 'myCountry' object. This
