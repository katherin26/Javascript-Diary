//forEach loop over the array and in each iteration it will execute this callback function.
//Also as the forEach method calls this callback function in each iteration it will pass in the current element
//It's a lot easier of the array as an argument to get access to the current index, We can specify them in our
//parameter list

//in iteration 2: function(400)
//....

//NOTE: When should you use forEach and for of =
/*
1) You cannot break out of the  forEach Loop, So the continue and break statements do not work in a forEach
loop at all. ForEach will always loop over the entire array .

If you need to break out of a loop then you have to keep isong the for of loop

//TITTLE: FOREACH WITH MAPS AND SETS

/*NOTE: This is an array of arrays and this inner array will be one entry of the map ,
where this 'USD' is the key and 'United States dollar' is the value , and so we can call forEach also on 
a map.*/

//NOTE: MAP AND FOREACH

const currencies = new Map([
  ['USD', 'United States dollar'],
  ['EUR', 'Euro'],
  ['GBP', 'Pound sterling'],
]);

currencies.forEach(function (value, key, map) {

USD: United States dollar
EUR: Euro
GBP: Pound sterling*/

/*
USD: USD
GBP: GBP
EUR: EUR
*/

/*The key is exactly the same as the value = Well , a set doesn't have keys and it doesn't have indexes
either and so there is no value that would make sense for the  key , so essentially this key here makes no
sense at all */

//TITTLE: Coding Challenge #1

/* 
Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners about their dog's age, 
and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing 
whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy 
if it's less than 3 years old.

Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and 
does the following things:

1. Julia found out that the owners of the FIRST and the LAST TWO dogs actually have cats, not dogs! So
 create a shallow copy of Julia's array, and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it's a 
 bad practice to mutate function parameters)
2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 
years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy 🐶")
4. Run the function for both test datasets


TEST DATA 1: Julia's data [3, 5, 2, 12, 7], Kate's data [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
TEST DATA 2: Julia's data [9, 16, 6, 8, 3], Kate's data [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
*/

function checkDogs(dogsJulia, dogsKate) {
  let copyDogsJulia = [...dogsJulia];
  let copyDogsKate = [...dogsKate];
  let correctDogsJulia = copyDogsJulia.slice(1, 3);
  let totalDogs = correctDogsJulia.concat(copyDogsKate);

  totalDogs.forEach(function (current, i, arr) {
    if (current >= 3) {
      console.log(
        `Dog number ${i + 1} is an adult, and is ${current} years old`
      );
    } else {
      console.log(`Dog number ${i + 1} is still a puppy 🐶!!`);
    }
  });
}

checkDogs([3, 5, 2, 12, 7], [4, 1, 15, 8, 3]);
checkDogs([9, 16, 6, 8, 3], [10, 5, 6, 1, 4]);
